# GoldTeamProject

OK, this is the bones of character movement, alongside some simple scripts & placeholder stuff. don't feel bad deleting/removing whatever, if you don't need it. the majority of assets in the project can be safely removed, but you might run into trouble removing scripts.

	The player character is basiccaly there to show off a simple system for buttons tied to different animations, if it's getting in the way you should be able to remove it entirely. the UI elements are built to work with mouse clicks & touch, if you'd like to connect your phone for playtesting.

	I've done my best to name everything as clearly as I can, please let me know if any code or scripting is confusing/acting up. 

	Thanks!
